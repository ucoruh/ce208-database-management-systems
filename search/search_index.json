The collection of data arranged in accordance with the purpose of use They are information stores with their logical and physical definitions. Database Examples \u00b6 University - Student Affairs Information System Hospital - Patient, doctor, treatment, equipment, financial information A commercial company - Customer, Product, Sales, Payment, Delivery information Bank - Customer, deposit, credit card, credit information Database \u00b6 The database concept was first introduced in the 1980s. It is used in everywhere from a simple web application up to large and complex data of international organizations Database applications are needed in many areas. What is Database Management System? \u00b6 It is a software system in which various complex following operations are performed. Creating a new database, Editing the database To use, Develop to take care of (maintanance) Classification of Database Management Systems \u00b6 By Data Model Hierarchical Network relational Object Oriented By Number of Users single user multi-user Hierarchical databases \u00b6 It is the first model used for databases. Hierarchical databases store information in a tree structure. Network databases \u00b6 When hierarchical databases were insufficient, a structure in which data was stored in the form of graphs, which is a more advanced version of trees, emerged at the end of the 1960s. Relational databases \u00b6 It was developed in the early 1970s. In this system, data is stored in tabular form. Connections between tables are represented by mathematical relationships. Almost all database programs today have this structure. Relational databases \u00b6 Object Oriented databases \u00b6 Objects used in many word processor and spreadsheet programs today are also used in databases. Object-oriented database means a database created and used in an object-oriented language such as C++ , C# , java , Visual Basic . Why use a database? \u00b6 The traditional approach to holding, storing and accessing data uses the approach of grouping data into separate files. With the increase in data and the need to access and edit data at the same time, the traditional approach has been inadequate. Advantages of the Database Approach \u00b6 Preventing duplication of common data; Ensuring centralized control and consistency of data Ensuring data sharing Hiding physical structure and access method complexities from the user with multi-layered architectures, Presenting only the data that is of interest to each user in easy, understandable structures Advantages of the Database Approach \u00b6 Ease of application software development with the analysis, design and development tools provided. Providing the necessary facilities for data integrity, Ensuring the desired level of security and confidentiality Solving operational problems such as backup, reboot, repair Database Management Systems \u00b6 Oracle database IBM DB/2 Adaptive Server Enterprise Informix Microsoft Access Microsoft SQL Server Microsoft Visual FoxPro MySQL Database Management Systems \u00b6 PostgreSQL Progress SQLite Teradata CSQL OpenLink Virtuoso Database Structure \u00b6 Table \u00b6 A database consists of data stored in tables. Tables are a group of data that is formed by arranging data in rows and columns. For example, 2 tables are created to store the course content and student information in the database: Student information contents Table \u00b6 Each piece of information in the table is called a record , and the columns are called a field . For example, in the student information table, following information is included. Student number, Name and surname, date of birth, Place of birth, E mail address Table \u00b6 Ogr_no Ad_soyad d_tarih d_yeri e-mail 1 Ay\u015fe \u00d6zt\u00fcrk 01.11.1979 Konya ayse@gazi.edu.tr 2 Sema \u00d6zdemir 24.05.1975 Ankara sema@gazi.edu.tr 3 Serdar G\u00fclp\u0131nar 06.06.1983 Adana serdar@gazi.edu.tr 4 Mehmet Efe 11.02.1978 Ni\u011fde mehmet@gazi.edu.tr 5 Zerrin Polat 22.08.1980 Antalya zerrin@gazi.edu.tr 6 Ulviye Kubal\u0131 12.12.1984 \u0130stanbul ulviye@gazi.edu.tr Table \u00b6 Fields Ogr_no Ad_soyad d_tarih d_yeri e-mail Record 1 Ay\u015fe \u00d6zt\u00fcrk 01.11.1979 Konya ayse@gazi.edu.tr 2 Sema \u00d6zdemir 24.05.1975 Ankara sema@gazi.edu.tr Data Types \u00b6 In order to have information about the structure of the records kept in the database, some properties of the fields must be defined beforehand. For example , the personnel registration number must be made up of integers, names and surnames must be words. MYSQL Data Types \u00b6 Numeric Date and Time Textual (String) Spatial MYSQL Data Types \u00b6 TINYINT : \u00b6 For very small integer values When Signed is defined, the values are between -128 and 127 . Unsigned defined range is between 0 and 255 . MYSQL Data Types \u00b6 SMALLINT : \u00b6 For small integer values When Signed is defined, the values are between -32768 and 32767. Unsigned defined range is 0 to 65535 . MYSQL Data Types \u00b6 MEDIUMINT : \u00b6 For medium-sized integer values. When Signed is defined, the values are between -8388608 and 8388607 . Unsigned defined range is between 0 and 16777215 . MYSQL Data Types \u00b6 INT(n):Interger \u00b6 For normal-sized integer values. When Signed is defined, the values are between -2147483648 and 2147483647 . Unsigned defined range is between 0 and 4294967295 . MYSQL Data Types \u00b6 BIGINT : \u00b6 For large integer values. Can take integer value -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807 MYSQL Data Types \u00b6 FLOAT : \u00b6 Keeps numbers with their fractions. Max. character width is taken as a parameter. ( up to 23 digits ) MYSQL Data Types \u00b6 DOUBLE: \u00b6 Keeps numbers with their fractions. Max. character width is taken as a parameter. ( 24 to 53 digits ) MYSQL Data Types \u00b6 DECIMAL: \u00b6 Keeps numbers with their fractions. The integer part can have a maximum 64 digits , and the fractional part a maximum 30 digits . MYSQL Data Types \u00b6 DATETIME: \u00b6 Datetime information in Year+Month+Day+Hour+Minute+Second format YYYY - MM - DD HH : MM : SS MYSQL Data Types \u00b6 TIMESTAMP: \u00b6 Time information from January 1, 1970 to January 18, 2038 , in the format Year+Month+Day+Hour+Minute+Second . YYYYMMDDHHMMSS MYSQL Data Types \u00b6 DATE: \u00b6 Date field that can change from 1000-01-01 to 9999-12-31 . YYYY - MM - DD MYSQL Data Types \u00b6 CHAR(n): \u00b6 Fixed-length data with n characters. MYSQL Data Types \u00b6 TEXT: \u00b6 A text field that can hold up to 65535 characters. MYSQL Data Types \u00b6 MEDIUMTEXT: \u00b6 Text field up to 16777215 characters MYSQL Data Types \u00b6 VARCHAR(n): \u00b6 Characters of varying size, not exceeding n MYSQL Data Types \u00b6 BOOL: \u00b6 A data type that takes the value 0 or 1 . or True/ False Key \u00b6 A key forces one or more fields to be entered as qualifiers for a row. There are 2 types of keys: Primary Key Foreign Key Primary key \u00b6 It is the key data that will enable access to a record. For example, there are two Ahmet among the students. Each student must have a unique number in order to find the Ahmet we want while searching. For example student number could be a primary key Multiple fields can have primary keys together Foreign key \u00b6 A foreign key is a set of attributes in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. The foreign key links these two tables. Foreign key \u00b6 Persons Table PersonID LastName FirstName Age 1 Hansen Ola 30 2 Svendson Tove 23 3 Pettersen Kari 20 Foreign key \u00b6 Orders Table OrderID OrderNumber PersonID 1 77895 3 2 44678 3 3 22456 2 4 24562 1 Foreign key \u00b6 Notice that the \"PersonID\" column in the \"Orders\" table points to the \"PersonID\" column in the \"Persons\" table. The \"PersonID\" column in the \"Persons\" table is the PRIMARY KEY in the \"Persons\" table. The \"PersonID\" column in the \"Orders\" table is a FOREIGN KEY in the \"Orders\" table. The FOREIGN KEY constraint prevents invalid data from being inserted into the foreign key column, because it has to be one of he values contained in the parent table. Database Design \u00b6 Objects are defined Library system: books, members, types, loan movements Designing a database \u00b6 A table is created for each object: book, members, types, woodc_movements Designing a database \u00b6 A key field is selected for each table book table: book no Members table: Userno Designing a database \u00b6 A column is added to the table for each property of the objects Book table: book number, year, author, name, related field Designing a database \u00b6 Additional tables are created for recurring object properties. request table: userno request_date Book_name Book_date Book_author Related_field . . . . . . . . . . . . Designing a database \u00b6 Fields that are not directly related to the table are determined. The address of the member who borrowed the book in the loan transactions table is not directly related to this table. This data should be included in the members table where member information is kept. Designing a database \u00b6 Relationships between tables should be defined. The relationship between the fields in a table is defined. For example, the userno field in the members table should be associated with the userno field in the request table .

Shopping list, to-do list, List of paid invoices Why we use the database? \u00b6 Why we use the database? \u00b6 Problems with lists; For example, the address of company B has changed. Address information in 3 lines should also change If it is missing, information inconsistency occurs. It can cause both a waste of time and an error . Why we use the database? \u00b6 Problems with lists; For example, company A no longer works with your company, If you delete the record related to company A from the list, you will lose information such as customer information and company address where the product was sold. Why we use the database? \u00b6 Problems with shared data; For example, different departments of your company need to display company information; Communication department: company, address Marketing department: company, price Customer service: customer name, job, company Why we use the database? \u00b6 Problems with shared data; Sharing all of this information with all departments is inconvenient for different reasons. Security customer privacy etc. Why we use the database? \u00b6 The biggest drawback for lists is that it combines different types of information into a table. Why we use the database? \u00b6 For DMS, the process of placing different types of information in different tables is called normalisation . For the previous list; customers Worked companies sales information Why we use the database? \u00b6 Customers Why we use the database? \u00b6 Worked Companies Why we use the database? \u00b6 Sales Information Why we use the database? \u00b6 When different types of information are placed in different tables, most of the problems related to the following works are eliminated; changing information deleted information with shared information. Why we use the database? \u00b6 When different types of data are in different tables; Relationships need to be established in order to answer questions such as which customer bought the product from which company ? Why we use the database? \u00b6 Relations Why we use the database? \u00b6 Relations Why we use the database? \u00b6 Joining tables So what is done to get the initial holistic list? SQL language is used. What is database management system? \u00b6 Components of the database system; What is database management system? \u00b6 The user does the following: It uses the database to perform its work, Adds new data Modify existing data, deletes data, Reads data through queries or reports What is database management system? \u00b6 Database Application: It is one or more computer programs that provide communication between the database management system and the user. Creates queries and reports, Receives data from the user or sends the data to the user, What is database management system? \u00b6 Database Management System: It receives requests from the application and performs them by reading or writing data on database files, It reads SQL statements and converts these statements into instructions for the computer's operating system to read or write data on database files. What is database management system? \u00b6 Functions of Database Application Functions of Database Management System What is database management system? \u00b6 Database Application: Creates and processes forms, Creates queries and forwards queries, Creates and operates reports, Performs application logic, Controls the application. What is database management system? \u00b6 Database Application: Creates and processes forms, for example, in a web-based application; Creates HTML and other web formats to be displayed on the user's computer, When the user fills out the forms and sends the data back, it sends the DBMS requests for the necessary adjustments. If an error occurs in the process, it displays the necessary message to the user and/or performs the necessary actions. What is database management system? \u00b6 Database Application: Creates queries and forwards queries, Generates the query to be transmitted to DBMS, These requests are usually expressed in SQL, When the query is executed, the results are formatted and transmitted to the user, What is database management system? \u00b6 Database Application: Creates and operates reports, Data is requested from DBMS through queries and query results are presented in the form of reports, What is database management system? \u00b6 Database Application: Performs application logic, For example, the user made a request for 10 units, but 8 units were found in stock, What happens depends on the logic of the program, It is the task of the application program to implement the appropriate logic. What is database management system? \u00b6 Database Application: Controls the application What is database management system? \u00b6 The Database Management System does the following: Creating the database, creating the tables, Reading data from the database and updating the data, Realizing the limitations on data values, It prevents one user's process from interfering with the other user's process. Allowing users to take action within the limits of their authority, Backing up data in the database. Database \u00b6 Database is data stores that consist of following related records. Metadata (metadata) index stored procedure trigger data integrity (referential integrity) Database \u00b6 Data about the structure of the database is called metadata. Table names column names Properties of tables and columns etc. Database \u00b6 Metadata example: Database \u00b6 Some databases contain application metadata. This metadata defines application components such as forms and reports. DBMS has several tools to show the structure of the database. Database \u00b6 At the same time, there are indexes used in databases to improve the performance of the database. Indexes are tools that show which records are in which tables. Database \u00b6 Stored procedures are compiled SQL statements. Because they are database objects, they are directly included in the database manager program. For example, stored procedures can be created for the purpose of taking a backup of data in a table or remove a backup of data that has passed more than a year. Database \u00b6 Stored procedures are codes for doing a specific duty defined in a database. These codes are optimized because they are compiled at the same time as they are written, and they are the fastest ready-to-run codes. Database \u00b6 A trigger is a special type of stored procedure that automatically runs when an event occurs in the database server. The events that trigger the triggers on the table are insert, update, delete events. Database \u00b6 For example, it is a typical use of triggers to decrease or increase the amount of stock as a result of stock movements. Database \u00b6 Since both triggers and stored procedures are codes on the database, they run on the database server. It is one of the powerful components of the Client & Server architecture. There are databases in client & server architecture as follows. Oracle, Sybase, MS SQL, Interbase, FireBird etc. Database \u00b6 Because they work on the server where the data is located, the data does not go back and forth between the client and the server. Therefore minimal data is sent from the server to the client side. Database \u00b6 In a relational database Let's assume that the department information of the person in the PERSONNEL table is kept in the SECTION_NO variable and the name of the department is in the SECTION table. Database \u00b6 If the section numbered as 1 is used by any personnel, the record with SECTION_NO value of 1 from the SECTION table must not be deleted. Protecting data integrity by making such controls is called referential integrity . Database \u00b6 The use of triggers is highly preferred in order to ensure data integrity. Database \u00b6 There can be 3 types of database systems: used by a single person, used by small businesses, Used by large international companies Database \u00b6 used by a single person, Painter Whose house was painted, when and how much? What was painted in the painting, what colors and styles were used? Who referenced others? Who are the referrals? Database Systems \u00b6 used by a single person, Database Systems \u00b6 used by a single person, Database Systems \u00b6 used by a single person, Database Systems \u00b6 used by small businesses, What are the rented musical instruments? How much is it rented? Which musical instruments are rented the most? Who made the lease? (multi-user database) The same instrument cannot be selected by two different dealers at the same time!

The collection of data arranged in accordance with the purpose of use They are information stores with their logical and physical definitions. Database Examples \u00b6 University - Student Affairs Information System Hospital - Patient, doctor, treatment, equipment, financial information A commercial company - Customer, Product, Sales, Payment, Delivery information Bank - Customer, deposit, credit card, credit information Database \u00b6 The database concept was first introduced in the 1980s. It is used in everywhere from a simple web application up to large and complex data of international organizations Database applications are needed in many areas. What is Database Management System? \u00b6 It is a software system in which various complex following operations are performed. Creating a new database, Editing the database To use, Develop to take care of (maintanance) Classification of Database Management Systems \u00b6 By Data Model Hierarchical Network relational Object Oriented By Number of Users single user multi-user Hierarchical databases \u00b6 It is the first model used for databases. Hierarchical databases store information in a tree structure. Network databases \u00b6 When hierarchical databases were insufficient, a structure in which data was stored in the form of graphs, which is a more advanced version of trees, emerged at the end of the 1960s. Relational databases \u00b6 It was developed in the early 1970s. In this system, data is stored in tabular form. Connections between tables are represented by mathematical relationships. Almost all database programs today have this structure. Relational databases \u00b6 Object Oriented databases \u00b6 Objects used in many word processor and spreadsheet programs today are also used in databases. Object-oriented database means a database created and used in an object-oriented language such as C++ , C# , java , Visual Basic . Why use a database? \u00b6 The traditional approach to holding, storing and accessing data uses the approach of grouping data into separate files. With the increase in data and the need to access and edit data at the same time, the traditional approach has been inadequate. Advantages of the Database Approach \u00b6 Preventing duplication of common data; Ensuring centralized control and consistency of data Ensuring data sharing Hiding physical structure and access method complexities from the user with multi-layered architectures, Presenting only the data that is of interest to each user in easy, understandable structures Advantages of the Database Approach \u00b6 Ease of application software development with the analysis, design and development tools provided. Providing the necessary facilities for data integrity, Ensuring the desired level of security and confidentiality Solving operational problems such as backup, reboot, repair Database Management Systems \u00b6 Oracle database IBM DB/2 Adaptive Server Enterprise Informix Microsoft Access Microsoft SQL Server Microsoft Visual FoxPro MySQL Database Management Systems \u00b6 PostgreSQL Progress SQLite Teradata CSQL OpenLink Virtuoso Database Structure \u00b6 Table \u00b6 A database consists of data stored in tables. Tables are a group of data that is formed by arranging data in rows and columns. For example, 2 tables are created to store the course content and student information in the database: Student information contents Table \u00b6 Each piece of information in the table is called a record , and the columns are called a field . For example, in the student information table, following information is included. Student number, Name and surname, date of birth, Place of birth, E mail address Table \u00b6 Ogr_no Ad_soyad d_tarih d_yeri e-mail 1 Ay\u015fe \u00d6zt\u00fcrk 01.11.1979 Konya ayse@gazi.edu.tr 2 Sema \u00d6zdemir 24.05.1975 Ankara sema@gazi.edu.tr 3 Serdar G\u00fclp\u0131nar 06.06.1983 Adana serdar@gazi.edu.tr 4 Mehmet Efe 11.02.1978 Ni\u011fde mehmet@gazi.edu.tr 5 Zerrin Polat 22.08.1980 Antalya zerrin@gazi.edu.tr 6 Ulviye Kubal\u0131 12.12.1984 \u0130stanbul ulviye@gazi.edu.tr Table \u00b6 Fields Ogr_no Ad_soyad d_tarih d_yeri e-mail Record 1 Ay\u015fe \u00d6zt\u00fcrk 01.11.1979 Konya ayse@gazi.edu.tr 2 Sema \u00d6zdemir 24.05.1975 Ankara sema@gazi.edu.tr Data Types \u00b6 In order to have information about the structure of the records kept in the database, some properties of the fields must be defined beforehand. For example , the personnel registration number must be made up of integers, names and surnames must be words. MYSQL Data Types \u00b6 Numeric Date and Time Textual (String) Spatial MYSQL Data Types \u00b6 TINYINT : \u00b6 For very small integer values When Signed is defined, the values are between -128 and 127 . Unsigned defined range is between 0 and 255 . MYSQL Data Types \u00b6 SMALLINT : \u00b6 For small integer values When Signed is defined, the values are between -32768 and 32767. Unsigned defined range is 0 to 65535 . MYSQL Data Types \u00b6 MEDIUMINT : \u00b6 For medium-sized integer values. When Signed is defined, the values are between -8388608 and 8388607 . Unsigned defined range is between 0 and 16777215 . MYSQL Data Types \u00b6 INT(n):Interger \u00b6 For normal-sized integer values. When Signed is defined, the values are between -2147483648 and 2147483647 . Unsigned defined range is between 0 and 4294967295 . MYSQL Data Types \u00b6 BIGINT : \u00b6 For large integer values. Can take integer value -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807 MYSQL Data Types \u00b6 FLOAT : \u00b6 Keeps numbers with their fractions. Max. character width is taken as a parameter. ( up to 23 digits ) MYSQL Data Types \u00b6 DOUBLE: \u00b6 Keeps numbers with their fractions. Max. character width is taken as a parameter. ( 24 to 53 digits ) MYSQL Data Types \u00b6 DECIMAL: \u00b6 Keeps numbers with their fractions. The integer part can have a maximum 64 digits , and the fractional part a maximum 30 digits . MYSQL Data Types \u00b6 DATETIME: \u00b6 Datetime information in Year+Month+Day+Hour+Minute+Second format YYYY - MM - DD HH : MM : SS MYSQL Data Types \u00b6 TIMESTAMP: \u00b6 Time information from January 1, 1970 to January 18, 2038 , in the format Year+Month+Day+Hour+Minute+Second . YYYYMMDDHHMMSS MYSQL Data Types \u00b6 DATE: \u00b6 Date field that can change from 1000-01-01 to 9999-12-31 . YYYY - MM - DD MYSQL Data Types \u00b6 CHAR(n): \u00b6 Fixed-length data with n characters. MYSQL Data Types \u00b6 TEXT: \u00b6 A text field that can hold up to 65535 characters. MYSQL Data Types \u00b6 MEDIUMTEXT: \u00b6 Text field up to 16777215 characters MYSQL Data Types \u00b6 VARCHAR(n): \u00b6 Characters of varying size, not exceeding n MYSQL Data Types \u00b6 BOOL: \u00b6 A data type that takes the value 0 or 1 . or True/ False Key \u00b6 A key forces one or more fields to be entered as qualifiers for a row. There are 2 types of keys: Primary Key Foreign Key Primary key \u00b6 It is the key data that will enable access to a record. For example, there are two Ahmet among the students. Each student must have a unique number in order to find the Ahmet we want while searching. For example student number could be a primary key Multiple fields can have primary keys together Foreign key \u00b6 A foreign key is a set of attributes in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. The foreign key links these two tables. Foreign key \u00b6 Persons Table PersonID LastName FirstName Age 1 Hansen Ola 30 2 Svendson Tove 23 3 Pettersen Kari 20 Foreign key \u00b6 Orders Table OrderID OrderNumber PersonID 1 77895 3 2 44678 3 3 22456 2 4 24562 1 Foreign key \u00b6 Notice that the \"PersonID\" column in the \"Orders\" table points to the \"PersonID\" column in the \"Persons\" table. The \"PersonID\" column in the \"Persons\" table is the PRIMARY KEY in the \"Persons\" table. The \"PersonID\" column in the \"Orders\" table is a FOREIGN KEY in the \"Orders\" table. The FOREIGN KEY constraint prevents invalid data from being inserted into the foreign key column, because it has to be one of he values contained in the parent table. Database Design \u00b6 Objects are defined Library system: books, members, types, loan movements Designing a database \u00b6 A table is created for each object: book, members, types, woodc_movements Designing a database \u00b6 A key field is selected for each table book table: book no Members table: Userno Designing a database \u00b6 A column is added to the table for each property of the objects Book table: book number, year, author, name, related field Designing a database \u00b6 Additional tables are created for recurring object properties. request table: userno request_date Book_name Book_date Book_author Related_field . . . . . . . . . . . . Designing a database \u00b6 Fields that are not directly related to the table are determined. The address of the member who borrowed the book in the loan transactions table is not directly related to this table. This data should be included in the members table where member information is kept. Designing a database \u00b6 Relationships between tables should be defined. The relationship between the fields in a table is defined. For example, the userno field in the members table should be associated with the userno field in the request table .

Address information in 3 lines should also change If it is missing, information inconsistency occurs. It can cause both a waste of time and an error . Why we use the database? \u00b6 Problems with lists; For example, company A no longer works with your company, If you delete the record related to company A from the list, you will lose information such as customer information and company address where the product was sold. Why we use the database? \u00b6 Problems with shared data; For example, different departments of your company need to display company information; Communication department: company, address Marketing department: company, price Customer service: customer name, job, company Why we use the database? \u00b6 Problems with shared data; Sharing all of this information with all departments is inconvenient for different reasons. Security customer privacy etc. Why we use the database? \u00b6 The biggest drawback for lists is that it combines different types of information into a table.

SQL language is used. What is database management system? \u00b6 Components of the database system; What is database management system? \u00b6 The user does the following: It uses the database to perform its work, Adds new data Modify existing data, deletes data, Reads data through queries or reports What is database management system? \u00b6 Database Application: It is one or more computer programs that provide communication between the database management system and the user. Creates queries and reports, Receives data from the user or sends the data to the user, What is database management system? \u00b6 Database Management System: It receives requests from the application and performs them by reading or writing data on database files, It reads SQL statements and converts these statements into instructions for the computer's operating system to read or write data on database files. What is database management system? \u00b6 Functions of Database Application Functions of Database Management System What is database management system? \u00b6 Database Application: Creates and processes forms, Creates queries and forwards queries, Creates and operates reports, Performs application logic, Controls the application. What is database management system? \u00b6 Database Application: Creates and processes forms, for example, in a web-based application; Creates HTML and other web formats to be displayed on the user's computer, When the user fills out the forms and sends the data back, it sends the DBMS requests for the necessary adjustments. If an error occurs in the process, it displays the necessary message to the user and/or performs the necessary actions. What is database management system? \u00b6 Database Application: Creates queries and forwards queries, Generates the query to be transmitted to DBMS, These requests are usually expressed in SQL, When the query is executed, the results are formatted and transmitted to the user, What is database management system? \u00b6 Database Application: Creates and operates reports, Data is requested from DBMS through queries and query results are presented in the form of reports, What is database management system? \u00b6 Database Application: Performs application logic, For example, the user made a request for 10 units, but 8 units were found in stock, What happens depends on the logic of the program, It is the task of the application program to implement the appropriate logic. What is database management system? \u00b6 Database Application: Controls the application What is database management system? \u00b6 The Database Management System does the following: Creating the database, creating the tables, Reading data from the database and updating the data, Realizing the limitations on data values, It prevents one user's process from interfering with the other user's process. Allowing users to take action within the limits of their authority, Backing up data in the database. Database \u00b6 Database is data stores that consist of following related records. Metadata (metadata) index stored procedure trigger data integrity (referential integrity) Database \u00b6 Data about the structure of the database is called metadata. Table names column names Properties of tables and columns etc. Database \u00b6 Metadata example: Database \u00b6 Some databases contain application metadata. This metadata defines application components such as forms and reports. DBMS has several tools to show the structure of the database. Database \u00b6 At the same time, there are indexes used in databases to improve the performance of the database. Indexes are tools that show which records are in which tables. Database \u00b6 Stored procedures are compiled SQL statements. Because they are database objects, they are directly included in the database manager program. For example, stored procedures can be created for the purpose of taking a backup of data in a table or remove a backup of data that has passed more than a year. Database \u00b6 Stored procedures are codes for doing a specific duty defined in a database. These codes are optimized because they are compiled at the same time as they are written, and they are the fastest ready-to-run codes. Database \u00b6 A trigger is a special type of stored procedure that automatically runs when an event occurs in the database server. The events that trigger the triggers on the table are insert, update, delete events. Database \u00b6 For example, it is a typical use of triggers to decrease or increase the amount of stock as a result of stock movements. Database \u00b6 Since both triggers and stored procedures are codes on the database, they run on the database server. It is one of the powerful components of the Client & Server architecture. There are databases in client & server architecture as follows. Oracle, Sybase, MS SQL, Interbase, FireBird etc. Database \u00b6 Because they work on the server where the data is located, the data does not go back and forth between the client and the server. Therefore minimal data is sent from the server to the client side. Database \u00b6 In a relational database Let's assume that the department information of the person in the PERSONNEL table is kept in the SECTION_NO variable and the name of the department is in the SECTION table. Database \u00b6 If the section numbered as 1 is used by any personnel, the record with SECTION_NO value of 1 from the SECTION table must not be deleted. Protecting data integrity by making such controls is called referential integrity . Database \u00b6 The use of triggers is highly preferred in order to ensure data integrity. Database \u00b6 There can be 3 types of database systems: used by a single person, used by small businesses, Used by large international companies Database \u00b6 used by a single person, Painter Whose house was painted, when and how much? What was painted in the painting, what colors and styles were used? Who referenced others? Who are the referrals?

How much is it rented? Which musical instruments are rented the most? Who made the lease? (multi-user database) The same instrument cannot be selected by two different dealers at the same time!
